Main functional benefits of the Enterprise version of WAPT

WAPT is designed to help IT system administrators manage the lifecycle
of their installed base of Windows applications.

With WAPT Enterprise, you benefit automatically from the base functions
included in WAPT to help you deploy, upgrade and remove software
and configurations on your Windows devices, from a central console.

WAPT is an *opencore* model and the **Enterprise** version is based
on the **Community** version with the following features designed
to answer the needs of large and medium Organisations:

* **Active Directory authentication** of WAPT package developers,
  package deployers, self-service users and for the initial registering
  of the WAPT agents with the WAPT Server. In addition, the display
  of WAPT equipped devices in the WAPT console follow the same structure
  as the hierarchical structure of the Organization's Active Directory
  :abbr:`OU (Organizational Units)`;

* **role separation between package developers and package deployers**.
  This way, central IT teams may build the software packages because they know
  the Organization's security guidelines, and local IT teams may deploy
  the WAPT packages because they know the needs of their user base.
  Such a separation is implemented using differentiated sets of keys
  (i.e. **Code Signing** SSL certificates for package developers and **Simple**
  SSL certificates for package deployers);

* **Use of differentiated self service**
  WAPT Enterprise allows you to define lists of allowed packages
  to existing groups in Active Directory.
  Users are free to install qualified packages without
  having to submit a ticket to their IT teams.

* **WAPT WUA**
  WAPT allows to manage the Windows Updates on your endpoints.

* **advanced reporting for corporate teams**.
  This reporting completes the operational reporting already available
  in the WAPT console; reports help WAPT operators demonstrate their efficacy
  with WAPT for insuring a greater level of security and conformity
  for their networks, systems, software and applications.

The Enterprise version of WAPT is particularly advisable for Organizations:

* that manage large installed bases of devices (generally above 300 units);

* that are spread geographically with many subsidiaries or production sites;

* that require a strong traceability of actions performed on the installed base
  of devices for reasons of audit or security;

Why does Tranquil IT display a 300 device limit for WAPT Community on her commercial documentation ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tranquil IT displays a 300 device limit on her commercial documentation
for the WAPT Community version.

.. note::

  There is **no technical restriction to using the Community version**,
  it is available as free software.

  Tranquil IT's philosophy regarding free software is to give back a little
  of what we took, so it is important to us to keep our original promise
  to give systems administrators a mean to deploy, maintain up-to-date
  and remove software and configurations on their installed base
  of Windows devices.

What you will find in the WAPT Enterprise version are features
that are designed to help administer large installed bases and we meet people
in that situation daily.

As a general rule, we have observed that advanced management needs start
to be felt when the number of devices goes over 300-400 units.
