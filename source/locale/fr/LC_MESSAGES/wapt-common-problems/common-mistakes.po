"to work correctly, a WAPT package needs to be self-contained. Indeed, we "
"do not know if the network will be available at the time of the "
"installation launch (for example if we have a waptexit that starts when "
"the workstation is shutting down on a network with 802.1x user "
"authentication, there will no longer be a network available at the time "
"of installation). The self-contained nature of WAPT makes it more "
"deterministic than other deployment solutions;"
